# Creating an Intelligent Agent Capable of Playing Connect 4 with Minimax Algorithm

The goal of this project was to develop an intelligent agent capable of playing a version of the game "Connect Four" (also known as Four in a Row, Drop Four, etc.). The minimax algorithm with a depth cut was used to develop the agent. An optimized version of the agent was also developed by making use of alpha-beta pruning.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have JDK installed, navigate either to minmax (non-optimized) or minmax.alphabeta (optimized) folders, compile all the classes and execute the main function:

```
javac *.java && java Main
```
